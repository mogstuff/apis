	You can query the API using HTTP REST requests, but it’s much easier to use the method included in the Javascript SDK : DZ.api.

Using the DZ.api method is very simple :

 the first argument is your query url, with a relative path. For example, if you want to search for an artist, you’ll make a GET request against http://api.deezer.com/2.0/search?q=eminem, which becomes DZ.api(‘/search ?q=eminem’, ..) ;
 the second argument is your callback function, called with the results of your request.
For starters, you’ll make a request to search for your favorite artist.
